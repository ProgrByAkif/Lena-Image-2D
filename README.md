In C, 2D arrays can be defined, almost the same as 1D arrays. Two-dimensional matrix can be used to represent arrays in code. A matrix is also used for
Image (image, e.g. jpg, GIF, etc.): So the image is a matrix, each pixel of the image stored in a cell of the matrix. This can be easily done with a 2D array where each element of the array represents a pixel of the image. A photo can also be depicted in simple characters. In this assignment we will use image processing along with Lena, this is a famous image often used in image processing.
